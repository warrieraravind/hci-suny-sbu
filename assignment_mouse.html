<strong>Assignment 4 - Part 1: 3D Design and Render a Mouse:</strong> </br>
<ul>
	<li>Use a real computer mouse or a picture of one as reference.</li>
	<li>Design it in FreeCAD to the best of your ability.</li>
	<li>Render it in Blender with Ray Tracing (realistic).</li>
	<li>Document: Show us your work!</li>
	<li>You don't have to make anything fancy. A simple design will be enough.</li>
	<li>The goal is to get acquainted with FreeCAD modeling and Blender rendering.</li>
	<li>It's best to start with a pencil sketch on paper, and then transfer the idea to digital form.</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/mouse_2.png" style="width:700px;height:500px;"> </br>
</br>
Then we used Blender to make it look more realistic. Following is the output of blender. </br>
