<strong>Assignment Doodles - Problem Statement:</strong> </br>
<ul>
	<li>Construct a circuit with at least one LED.</li>

	<li>Document it with Fritzing (+ circuit diagram), as well as photographs, circuit diagram.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a page for it on your website and upload the images and text.</li>
		<li>Since you're working in a team - only one person can do the uploading and the other person needs to link to it from their own page.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Calculate and write down the Voltage (Volts), Resistance (Ohms) and Current (Amps) in the circuit. Advanced hackers can even build a voltmeter using their Arduino to verify their calculations... :) (https://blog.udemy.com/arduino-voltmeter/)
	</li>
	<li>Code a program that drives the LED to ‘write in space’, when using your phone’s camera to look at it.</li>
	<li>Move the phone (or the arduino & breadboard) in space and see the “writing” in the photo. Will work best in low light without using flash - long exposure image.</li>
	<li>The "painting" can be very simple. Just a dotted line, which is basically the LED going on and off in a loop, is probably OK. You are encouraged to go further, add an LED or two and create a nicer pattern that conveys more information, even text! (with say 4 LEDs)</li>
	<li>Basically all you need to know about driving LEDs is here: https://learn.adafruit.com/all-about-leds?view=all</li>
	<li>And all the Arduino you need to know is here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/blink</li>
</ul>
