<strong>Assignment 2 - Part 2: Sensor reading - Problem Statement:</strong> </br>
<ul>
	<li>Construct a circuit with at least one sensor and at least one LED.</li>
	<li>Use the datasheet for your sensor to understand its response characteristics.
		<ul>
			<li>If it's resistive (changes resistance) - see how many Ohms you get in different stages of operation.</li>
			<li>You will benefit from picking a resistor value (or a series, parallel bunch of resistors) to help you span the entire range of the resistive sensor.</li>
			<li>Linearize the response with a multimap if needed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Output the sensor value also to the serial console: Convert raw values to meaningful readings (e.g. "lux", "degrees Celsius", etc.)</li>
	<li>Use the sensor to also drive the LED
		<ul>
			<li>Use map according to the characteristics of the sensor and your linearization.</li>
			<li>Use PWM to drive the LED from totally dark to ON, corresponding with the sensor read values.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
		
	<li>Apply a filter to condition the signal:
		<ul>
			<li>a hardware RC filter, for which you'd need a capacitor - calculate the cutoff frequency.</li>
			<li>a software filter: moving average, median, IIR (Butterworth), etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Document it with Fritzing (+ circuit diagram), as well as photographs, circuit diagram.</li>
	<li>Write down the voltages, and operational ranges of your sensor</li>
	<li>Plot the results from the sensor (after and before calibration, filtering): You can use Excel, Google Sheets, gnuplot, or anything else you are used to working with.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Answer:</strong> </br>

<p>
	We connected the Photo resistor in series to a 10kilo-ohm resistor and measured the voltage that is read on one leg of the photo resistor. The max voltage that is supplied is 5V, since it is connected to USB. 0-5V is mapped between 0-1023 in the analogRead api that is used. This is mapped to 0-255 before doing a digitalWrite. The output is written to the 13th pin. An LED is connected on that leg, through a resistor of 1 kilo-ohm. We invert the reading that is read in the analogWrite, so that if it is dark, the LED lights and when there is light, the LED turns off.
</p>
<p>
	If 'x' is the input reading for AnalogRead, then the voltage drop across the resistor R is, (x/1023) * 5 Volts. Then the current flowing through the circuit at this time is V/R = ((x/1023) * 5)/ 10 * 10^4. Now, the voltage drop across the photo resistor is (1023 - x)/1023) * 5 V. Now, since the current is the same across both the resistors, the resistance of the photo resistor is V/I. Cancelling out terms, R = ((1023 - x) / x) * 10 ^ 4 ohms.
