<strong>Assignment 5: Sketching, problems and solutions</strong> </br>





<ul>
	<li>Find a problem to solve.</li>
	<li>Tell us about it</li>
	<li>How did you find it?</li>
	<li>How do you propose to solve it?</li>
	<li>You don't have to make anything fancy. A simple design will be enough.</li>
	<li>Sketch the solution (use paper, video, stop motion, pencil sketch, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Answer:</strong> </br>
We propose two ideas that we think would qualify to be our final project for this course: </br>

<h3>Idea 1:</h3>
<strong>A Guitar Tutor HW</strong> </br>
I am a self made guitarist and I had a hard time learning it myself. I had to go through a lot of Video Tutorials, Tab sheets etc, to </br>
to figure out the notes/chords for a song. </br>

<p>What if there is a hardware out there that can be connected to the guitar which itself shows you how to play any song, if you know the basics of playing a guitar?</p>

<p>There will be a 3-D printed flat board that you can insert between the frut board and the strings. This is so thin that it won't touch the strings. This flat board will have 6 leds and 6 sensors each between every frets. This is something that you can insert under the fret board and it gets locked by itself in place. The leds will light in 4 different colors, representing each of the 4 fingers of the player. When the player correctly places his fingers over the flat board, he touches the sensors and the next set of tabs for the next chords/beat will light up. All the leds and sensors are connected to the main bus that runs just outside of the neck of the guitar.</p>
