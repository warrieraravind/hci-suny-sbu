<strong>Assignment - Design a User Study</strong> </br>
<strong><p>What you want to (can :) measure - the Dependent Variable.</p></strong>
	<p>
		The dependent variable is a measured human behaviour. The independent variables in our case are the following:
		<ul>
			<li>The number of mistakes the user makes in a song
				<p>We count the number of mistakes that the user makes while playing the song. This can be easily be             
	          found, by counting the number of crosses that are shown in the android app. The Android app                 
	          continuously monitors the notes that the user is playing. The only wrong notes that the app doesn't 
	          catch is when the user plays an open note (a note played with no fingers on the fret)</p>
          	</li>
          	<li>Time he takes to complete a song
				<p> Another variable that we can measure is the time that the user takes to finish a song. We understand 
          that the user's previous experience with playing a guitar and familiarity with the song can play a 
          role on this varible as well.</p>
          	</li>
          	<li>Accuracy
				<p>This is another variable similar to the number of mistakes. May be we can use accuracy to measure the 
         correctness of the notes played by the user over all the set of songs he is asked to play.</p>
          	</li>         
		</ul>
	</p>
<strong>How will you get two populations to compare: Experimental or Correlational.</strong>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				We have only one device to work with. So the only option we have to is to correlational comparison. We will give the guitar to many users and measure how quick they can finish the song and the number of errors that they made while playing the song. Also, we will ask the user to play songs that he is familiar and unfamiliar with. Also for those who already have previous experience with playing the guitar, we will give them random notes to be played, which will require them to look at the LED and figure out which note to play. This way we can get to know the efficacy of the device that we designed.
				
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<strong>What are the experimental manipulations or choices - the Independent Variable.</strong>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Feedback (On/Off)
				<p>
					We use the android application as a feed back to the user. We will be doing two sets of experiments. 
         One with the user given the feed back. So that the user can get to know whether he played the right or 
         not. Also, he can know what is the next note to be played.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Familiarity with the song
				<p>
					Another set of experiments involve the user being asked to play songs that he is familiar/unfamiliar 
         with. This can help us understand the influence of this independent variable
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<strong>Control Variables.</strong>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Song
				<p>
					Familiarity with the song can play a role on the effect of this device. If the user is familiar with the song, then he can easily know whether the note he/she is going play is a higher/lower note. And accordingly he can prepare himself to play the note.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Ambient lighting
				<p>
					The lighting on the room is important in this experiment. A little dark room can help the user to identify the color of the LED but a minimum lighting is required for him to figure out the fret and string that he wants to play.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
