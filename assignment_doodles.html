<strong>Answer:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Use the principles reviewed in class to hypothesize a problem and a solution.</li>
	</br>
	Problem Identified: </br>

	<p>Most of us are frequent travellers and and we always will have a restriction on the luggage weight that we carry. On an average one will spend atleast $100 on a regular XL bag. But to weigh the bag, we need to buy another weighing scale. Also you will have to hold the bag correctly to accurately measure the weight of the bag. </p>

	</br>

	Suggested Solution: </br>

	<p>
	I propose a new luggage bag which has the capability to show the weight of the bag through a 7-segment display attached to the bag itself. The bag will have load sensors attached to each of the four wheels and the will measure the force exerted on each of the wheels. The measure force is then used to calculate the weight of the whole bag. Since there is a load sensor attached to each of the four wheels, the weight of the bag can be accurately calculated even placed on an irregular surface.
