<strong>Answer:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Use the principles reviewed in class to hypothesize a problem and a solution.</li>
	</br>
	Problem Identified: </br>

	<p>Most of us are frequent travellers and and we always will have a restriction on the luggage weight that we carry. On an average one will spend atleast $100 on a regular XL bag. But to weigh the bag, we need to buy another weighing scale. Also you will have to hold the bag correctly to accurately measure the weight of the bag. </p>

	</br>

	Suggested Solution: </br>

	<p>
	I propose a new luggage bag which has the capability to show the weight of the bag through a 7-segment display attached to the bag itself. The bag will have load sensors attached to each of the four wheels and the will measure the force exerted on each of the wheels. The measure force is then used to calculate the weight of the whole bag. Since there is a load sensor attached to each of the four wheels, the weight of the bag can be accurately calculated even placed on an irregular surface.
	</p>


	<li>Doodle, sketch, storyboard, or write up the solution and upload to your page.</li>

	<p>
		The new luggage bag that I propose will have 4 load sensors attached to its wheels and it will measure the load exerted on the wheels and these loads will be passed to the weight calculator attached to the display. Also there is a button next to the display which can be used to switch between Lbs/Kg. This button will  be the signifier and is evident to the user from the previous experience that the button will do something. The display is an auto turn-off display which will turn off itself after 30/60 seconds.

	<li>If this is a GUI product - sketch mock-ups of the UI.</li>

	<p>This is not a GUI product.</p>

	<li>Annotate your use of affordances, signifiers, cognitive models.</li>

	<p>
		The affordances of the new bag will have all the affordances of a regular luggage bag. In addition, it will have a new display attached to it. The new display attached has the ability to switch between Kilograms and Lbs. There is button next to the display that can be pressed. This button will be a signifier for the user, which says that something will happen if you press it. Also, this is a label next to the button which says Kg/Lb which clearly says the user that this button will switch between Point and Kilogram. So this clearly is a good cognitive model. The whole new "electronics part" can be run on a cheap cell, which makes the new bag cheaper in maintenance as well.
	</p>

	<li>Write who would you like to test your hypothesized technology with, and how.</li>

	<p>
		The technology can be tested by distributing the new luggage bag to any new buyer and see if he is satisfied or not in the future.
	</p>
	
	<li>Think how you would evaluate success or failure.</li>
	<p>
		This success or failure can be evaluated by doing a poll among the buyers, whether he had a problem with the functioning of the weigning machine attached to the bag. Also if there is a scenario in which the user fails to check in his baggage in an airline or any such scenarios. That can be considered as a failure case.
