<strong>Assignment 3 - Part 1: 2D Design</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Design a case for your Arduino board.</li>
	<li>Take measurements or use CAD model (e.g. http://www.123dapp.com/smb-123D_Design/Arduino-Uno-R3/1677887). You can Google and find many more...</li>
	<li>Take into account the cables (e.g. USB), and provide holes for them.</li>
	<li>Think about the material thickness, kerf, screws diameter (we use M3 (3mm) and M4 (4mm) screws and hex nuts).</li>
	<li>Produce a 2D laser cutting diagram.</li>
	<li>Bonus: Design a case also for a sensor and some LEDs - make a real device!</li>
	<li>Document your work (this is what you will be graded on :) pencil sketches, digital design, nesting / cut plan, any annotations to explain your design choices.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
</br>
We took the arduino measurement from the arduino site and used the tool Inkscape to create a 2D box for Arduino. Before using the Inkscape, we used the site makercase.com to create a 2D design for the arduino case with the dimensions: </br>
	Length: 2.7 inches = 68.58mm </br>
	Breadth: 2.1 inches = 53.34mm </br>
	Height: 10.5mm </br>
We will be using a card-board box for constructing the box. We assume that the kerf width is 0.2mm. </br>
We used the following diagram as the reference for building the box: </br>

Following is the plan of the box, designed in makercase: </br>

Following is the 2d diagram built using Inkscape: </br>
